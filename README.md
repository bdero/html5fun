html5fun; some small html5 canvas applications developed with jsGameSoup
===================================
github.com/CheeseKeg/html5fun

Purpose
-----------------------------------
I was thinking about developing a small entity management system to be licensed under GNU GPLv3 for making free (as in freedom) html5 games. I soon stumbled across jsGameSoup, realizing that, while it's only under a 'weak' copyleft free software license (LGPLv3), this had already been done (and quite well at that!)

Eager to give it a try, this repository is my jsGameSoup playground.
